Actual-Size 

The techniques in this project can be used to:
 -Derive the physical size of a screen in inches and therefore the level of portability of the screen.
 -Scale images to display the image contents at actual size on the screen.
 -Add an appropriate amount of padding to links to make the hit area match an optimal finger tip size.

Sadly, the "resolution", "max-resolution" & "min-resolution" media-query keywords are currently only supported by Firefox. 

This is just an exercise in using it.
